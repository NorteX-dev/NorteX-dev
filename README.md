##  NorteX
### Welcome to my profile!

Hello, I'm NorteX or as often referred to as nortexdev. I live and study in Poland. I'm a passionate TypeScript dev with plenty of hours in other languages as well.

I've been programming for over 6 years and started with Java, however quickly switched off of it in favor of other OOP languages like C# and JavaScript. Nowadays I mostly stick with TypeScript, the better counterpart of JavaScript. Though I like to think of myself as a back-end dev, I also interact a lot with web technologies, both back and front-end, such as React and Svelte.

I'm currently at university studying general-purpose CS, doing freelance work, contributing to and making FOSS projects and making paid products.

### The languages I know
- **TypeScript** - the language I love and know most.
  - React
  - Svelte
  - Astro
  - Node.js and Bun, Express
  - ORMs and database adapters
- **Java** - still holds a soft spot in my heart, being my first language.
- **C#**
- **Lua**
- **Python**
- **C++** - only for university purposes
- Bash-like langs.
- SQL

Languages I wish I knew better:
> - **Rust** - ownerships scare me

Except for programming, I also do non-commercial graphic design, system administration and for-fun music making.
